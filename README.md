Llama â€” a terminal file manager.

Why another file manager? I wanted something simple and minimalistic.
Something to help me with faster navigation in the filesystem; a `cd` and `ls`
replacement. So I build "llama". It allows for quick navigation with fuzzy
searching. `cd` integration is quite simple. And you can open `vim` right from
the llama. That's it. As simple and dumb as a llama.

## Install

```
go install github.com/antonmedv/llama@latest
```

Or download [prebuild binaries](https://github.com/antonmedv/llama/releases).


Put the next function into **~/.bashrc** or **~/.config/fish/functions/ll.fish**:

<table>
<tr>
  <th> Bash </th>
  <th> Fish </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```bash
function ll {
  cd "$(llama "$@")"
}
```

</td>
<td>

```fish
function ll
    cd (llama $argv);
end
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


Note: we need a such helper as the child process can't modify the working directory of the parent process.

## Usage

| Key binding | Description     |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `Arrows`    | Move cursor     |
| `Enter`     | Enter directory |
| `Backspace` | Exit directory  |
| `[A-Z]`     | Fuzzy search    |

The `EDITOR` or `LLAMA_EDITOR` environment variable used for openning files from the llama.

```
