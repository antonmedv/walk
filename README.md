Llama â€” a terminal file manager.

Why another file manager? I wanted something simple and minimalistic.
Something to help me with faster navigation in the filesystem; a `cd` and `ls`
replacement. So I build "llama". It allows for quick navigation with fuzzy
searching. `cd` integration is quite simple. And you can open `vim` right from
the llama. That's it. As simple and dumb as a llama.

## Install

```
brew install llama
```

```
snap install llama
```

```
pkg_add llama
```

```
go install github.com/antonmedv/llama@latest
```

Or download [prebuild binaries](https://github.com/antonmedv/llama/releases).

Put the next function into the **.bashrc** or a similar config:

<table>
<tr>
  <th> Bash </th>
  <th> Fish </th>
  <th> PowerShell </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

```bash
function ll {
  cd "$(llama "$@")"
}
```

</td>
<td>

```fish
function ll
  set loc (llama $argv); and cd $loc;
end
```

</td>
<td>

```powershell
function ll() {
  cd "$(llama $args)"
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>


Note: we need a such helper as the child process can't modify the working
directory of the parent process.
